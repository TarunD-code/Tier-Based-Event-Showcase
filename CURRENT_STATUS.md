## ❌ **Current Issue (5% Remaining)**

### 🗄️ **Database Seeding Problem**
- **Status**: Database connected but empty (0 events)
- **Error**: RLS (Row Level Security) policies blocking insertions
- **Impact**: Users can't see any events

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is that Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policies are preventing the seeding API from inserting data. This is a common issue when:

1. **RLS is enabled** but policies are too restrictive
2. **API key permissions** are limited
3. **Database setup** needs manual intervention

## 🚀 **Solution: Manual Database Setup**

Since the automated seeding is blocked by RLS, we need to manually set up the database:

### **Step 1: Run SQL Setup Script**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com)
2. Open your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run the SQL from `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### **Step 2: Verify Setup**
- Check that 8 events are created (2 per tier)
- Test the application pages

## 📋 **Immediate Action Required**

**You need to manually run the database setup SQL in Supabase.**

The SQL script will:
- ✅ Create the events table
- ✅ Temporarily disable RLS
- ✅ Insert 8 sample events
- ✅ Re-enable RLS with permissive policies
- ✅ Create performance indexes

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Setup**

After running the SQL script:

1. **Database Test Page**: Should show "✅ Connected! Found 8 events"
2. **Events Page**: Should display all events with tier filtering
3. **Seeding Tool**: Should work for future updates
4. **Application**: 100% functional
